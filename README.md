# RepoMate ðŸ§‰

A command-line tool to manage and synchronize multiple git repositories. This tool helps you maintain a list of git repositories and keep them up to date with their remote sources.

## Features

- Maintain a list of repositories to sync
- Add and remove repositories from the sync list
- Automatically clone new repositories
- Update existing repositories
- Configurable paths for code and configuration storage

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system
2. Copy `repomate.rb` to `~/.local/bin/`:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp repomate.rb ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/repomate.rb
```

3. Add the fish function to your fish config:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/functions
cp repomate.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/
```

## Usage

The tool can be used either directly through Ruby or via the fish shell function.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Sync all repositories
repomate sync

# Add a repository to the sync list
repomate add https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Remove a repository from the sync list
repomate remove https://github.com/user/repo.git

# List all repositories in the sync list
repomate list
```

### Configuration Options

You can customize the following paths:

```bash
# Set custom home directory
repomate --home-path /custom/home

# Set custom code directory
repomate --code-path /custom/code

# Set custom config file location
repomate --config-file /custom/config.txt
```

### Default Paths

- Home Path: `$HOME`
- Code Path: `$HOME/code`
- Config File: `$HOME/.config/alex-scripts/repomate/subscribed.txt`

## Configuration File

The configuration file is a simple text file with one repository URL per line. For example:

```text
https://github.com/user/repo1.git
https://github.com/user/repo2.git
https://github.com/organization/repo3.git
```

The file will be automatically created at `~/.config/alex-scripts/repomate/subscribed.txt` if it doesn't exist.

## Behavior

- When syncing repositories:
  - If a repository doesn't exist locally, it will be cloned
  - If a repository exists locally, it will be updated (git pull)
  - Updates are performed on the 'main' branch

- When adding repositories:
  - Duplicate repositories are not allowed
  - The URL is validated before adding

- When removing repositories:
  - Only the repository URL is removed from the sync list
  - The local repository files are not deleted

## Requirements

- Ruby
- Git
- Fish shell (for fish function integration)

## Error Handling

The tool includes error handling for common scenarios:

- Missing directories are automatically created
- Invalid repository URLs are reported
- Network issues during sync are handled gracefully
- Duplicate repository additions are prevented
